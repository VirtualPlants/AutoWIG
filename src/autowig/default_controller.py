    """Post-processing step of an AutoWIG front-end

    During this step, three distinct operations are executed:

        * The **overloading** operation.
          During this operation functions and methods of the Abstract Semantic Graph (ASG) are traversed in order to determine if they are overloaded or not.
          This operation has at worst a time-complexity in :math:`\mathcal{O}\left(F^2\right)` where :math:`F` denotes the number of functions and methods in the ASG.
          Therefore, its default behavior is altered and all functions and methods are considered as overloaded which induces a time-complexity of :math:`\mathcal{O}\left(N\right)` where :math:`N` denotes the number of nodes in the ASG.

        * The **discarding** operation.

        * The **templating** operation.

    :Parameter:
        `overload` (bool) - The boolean considered in order to determine if the behavior of the **overloading** operation is altered or not.

    :Return Type:
        `None`
